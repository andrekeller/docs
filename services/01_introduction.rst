Introduction
============

This documentation has been created with the intention of getting developers ready to automatically deploy their apps to the OpenShift container platform.

We try to achieve this using an exemplary microservice application with basic functionalities of an online shop. Each microservice is continuously integrated and deployed to `APPUiO <https://appuio.ch>`_ (our public OpenShift platform), which allows for an independent description of the necessary pipeline as well as the most relevant concepts for the respective use case.

Before we describe the architecture of our application in more detail, let us shortly summarize what the following chapters include (in order):

Architecture of our shop application
------------------------------------

A first clear distinction in our application's architecture can be made between the frontend and the backend of the application. The frontend only contains a single service, which is the **Webserver**. The Webserver is an instance of Nginx that serves some static files (the compiled JS application).

The backend consists of multiple microservices: the main endpoint (**API**) that is accessed from the frontend of the application, a service that handles user management and authentication (**Users**), a service that handles order management (**Orders**) and a service responsible for sending emails (**Mailer**). API, Users and Orders each manage their own database to enforce separation of concerns. The API connects to the other services by using their respective REST endpoints whenever it needs a timely response.


Structure of this documentation
-------------------------------

This documentation is structured such that we first make sure that you know of the most relevant topics and prerequisites for following along later on. The chapter about **General Concepts** provides a short motivation for concepts like Docker and OpenShift and guides you to useful resources if you need to deepen your knowledge about those topics.

The following chapters will each describe one of our services more in depth. We go into how a continuous integration pipeline might be built and how the respective service might be packaged for OpenShift, as well as several more advanced topics. We generally try to account for best practices like the `12-Factor App <https://12factor.net>`_.
