Deployment to prod
==================

The final step in our pipeline is the deployment to production (aka "going live"). As this is critical, the job should only be run after it has been manually triggered, which is why we introduce ``when: manual``. The deployment will then have to be triggered from the GitLab UI.

Another important difference is that this job doesn't actually build an image: it reuses the image that has been deployed to preprod and just adds the tag *live* to this image ``oc tag xyz:stable xyz:live``. This corresponds to best practice as another build could possibly result in a different version of the image. We always want preprod and prod environment to be based on exactly the same image.
